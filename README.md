# Dimri_S_Portfolio

Hello, I'm Siddhant and this is my portfolio, I've built it, with the help of my professors and combining my own will to learn. It is a project in making but I've tried to include everything that I wanted to show.

Requirements~

*If you want to open in a web browser~*

1. I worked on a local FTP server and the files are accessible here, the site is live at http://siddhant.website/Dimri_S_Portfolio/index.html

*If you want to develop on my project*

1. Use a local Server, everytime I don't use it i get a CORS policy error and I recommend use WAMP or MAMP, if you want ot use localhost.
2. Vue is intsalled already, don't worry.
3. I have index.html as well as index.php as I was working without php before I kept that in mind and didn't scrap my html file. So that provides a little flexibility when somebody would try to open the site manually.
